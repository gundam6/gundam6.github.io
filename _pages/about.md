<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student at [Department of Road and Airport Engineering](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/info/1502/5651.htm) in [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn) since Fall‚Äô21. I am being advised by Prof. [Hongduo Zhao](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hongduo-Zhao) at [Jianming Ling's Lab](https://jmling.tongji.edu.cn).

For detailed information about my academic journey, you can refer to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w1wLYCg99JiyHYf8Uog1Pk8MPvFhERYW/view?usp=share_link).

I am generally interested in the intersection of **Topology Optimization** and **Airport Pavement Engineering**. Specifically I am looking at:

- Lightweight design of pavement structures based on topology optimization
- Topology optimization method that account for uncertain load locations
- 3D concrete printing technology & prefabrication techniques
